*  The middleware communication is based on the publisher/subscriber protocol.
*  Publishers make messages public under a given topic.
*  Subscribers to a given topic get all messages which are published
*  under the given topic.
*  To establish a transfer path, both:
*  publisher and subscriber have to share the same topic.
*
* Each subscriber has a reference to the associated topic and a putter
* to store messages.
* All subscribers are registered in a list.
* Each time a messages is published the list of all subscriber will be search and
* for each subscriber where the topic matches the associated putter will be called
* to store a copy of the published message.
