/**
 * A gateway is a link from the local middleware to an external network.
 * A single middleware may have many gateways, each connecting to one different external link.
 * To send messages, a Gateway works like a normal subscriber to read data from the middleware topics,
 * but it can respond to more than one topic.
 * Messages received from the external link will be distributed in the
 * loccal middleware using the same mechaninsm like normal topics.
 *
 * To read from the network link, the gateway implements a thread
 * which may poll the link or may be reactivated by interrupts from the link.
 *
 * Some intelligent networks may deliver a list of topics which are expected
 * externally. To access other networks, the user has to define which
 * topics shall be forwarded (or forward all, but may be inefficient TODO OFr Explain why!).
